### Gene Selection and Novelty Assessment

From the initial 39 genes identified in the cTWAS analysis, I selected 21 genes with high relevance to coronary artery disease (CAD), based on evidence from GeneCards, literature searches, and AI-assisted prioritization (ChatGPT). This page evaluates whether these genes represent novel findings in CAD research.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r}
load("gene_assessment_filter.RData")
DT::datatable(gene_assessment_filter,caption = htmltools::tags$caption(style = 'caption-side: topleft; text-align = left; color:black;','Summary of highly plausible genes'),
              options = list(pageLength = 10))
```
