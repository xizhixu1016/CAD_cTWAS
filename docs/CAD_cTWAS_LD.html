Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xizhixu1016/CAD_cTWAS/tree/95724c0e3f83989549416ed65a675187c872063c" target="_blank">95724c0</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>In this analysis, I extended to LD version of cTWAS, which means possible to find multiple causal signals per LD region. Our expectation was to find more significant genes than before. The analyzed disease was CAD, and the prediction model was trained on GTEx v8 in the PredictDB format.</p>

<p>When the variants in prediction model span two regions, it would be unclear to cTWAS what region the gene should assign to. It would cause cross-region LD issue and may lead to false positive findings.</p>
<p>Our solution was to perform “region merging” as a post-processing step. If any gene has variants in the weights that span two or more regions (“cross-boundary”), those regions will be merged, and cTWAS will rerun the fine-mapping step on the merged regions.</p>

<p>Our basic strategy of dealing with LD mismatch was: we use the list of problematic SNPs to identify the molecular traits whose results may be affected by LD-mismatch. We would then run SuSiE fine-mapping with L = 1 in the regions containing these molecular traits, assuming a single causal signal in such a region. The fine-mapping results in this setting would be independent of LD.</p>
<p>We chose the genes with some plausibility of being risk genes (gene PIP &gt; 0.5) and problematic SNPs in their weights. We would then select regions containing these problematic genes.</p>

<p>The top track showed -log10(p-value) of the association of variants (from CAD GWAS) and molecular traits (from the package computed z-scores) with the phenotype.</p>
<p>The mid track showed PIPs of variants and molecular traits. We limited PIP results to credible sets in the PIP track (filter_cs = TRUE).</p>
<p>The next track showed the QTLs of the focal gene. We chose the molecular trait with the top 3 highest PIP (TRMT61B, ZNHIT3, BOP1).</p>
<p>The bottom was the gene track. We limited results to protein coding genes by default. We could draw a red dotted line to show the PIP cutoff of 0.8 by setting highlight_pip = 0.8.</p>

<p>To sum up, “Negative regulation of cell adhesion” refers to biological processes that reduce, inhibit, or prevent cells from adhering (sticking) to each other or to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Negative regulation of cell adhesion can be relevant to CAD because cell adhesion plays a crucial role in vascular health. Some key connections include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Endothelial Dysfunction &amp; Atherosclerosis: In CAD, endothelial cells (which line blood vessels) lose their ability to properly regulate adhesion molecules, leading to inflammation.</p></li>
<li><p>Leukocyte (White Blood Cell) Adhesion &amp; Inflammation: If adhesion is negatively regulated, immune cells might not be able to properly attach and clear damaged endothelial cells, leading to chronic inflammation—a hallmark of CAD.</p></li>
</ul>
